Flight Route Optimization

Project Overview

This project aims to optimize flight routes between cities using Dijkstra’s Algorithm. It helps find the most efficient flight paths based on cost, distance, and duration, making travel planning faster and more cost-effective.

Features

Graph-Based Flight Network – Models flights as a weighted graph.

Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation – Finds the shortest and most cost-effective paths.

Multiple Optimization Factors – Routes can be optimized based on cost or distance.

Efficient Pathfinding – Handles multiple flight options dynamically.

User-Friendly Input & Output – Users can input city details and get optimized routes.

Estimated Fuel Cost Calculation – Computes approximate fuel cost for travel.

Technologies Used

C++ (for algorithm implementation)

STL (Standard Template Library) (for graph structures like vectors and priority queues)
